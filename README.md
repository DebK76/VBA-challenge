First repository- Module 2 homewrok
For this particular challenge, I was tasked with creating a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
The ticker symbol, Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
The percentage chnage from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
The total stock volume of the stock. 
Additionally, adding functionality to my code to reflect the stock with the "greatest" % increase & decrease, and "greatest total volume"
I wrote a code that would the VBA script on every worksheet for each of the years (2018, 2019, and 2020 all at once

Please see screenshots of results, VBA Script files
